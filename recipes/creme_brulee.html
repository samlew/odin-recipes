      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Cream, eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla are all that’s needed to make the perfect homemade creme brulee. That simple combination of ingredients creates the most luxurious creamy custard, with a silky texture and rich vanilla flavor just like you’d find in a high-end restaurant. It’s one of our favorite homemade desserts.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>5 large egg yoks</li>
        <li>0.5 cups sugar, plus some extra for caramelizing</li>
        <li>1 pinch fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extra or vanilla bean paste</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300˚F. Pour heavy cream into a medium saucepan and set over medium heat, stirring frequently until steaming and almost at a simmer then add vanilla and remove from heat. </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together 5 egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt until blended. While whisking constantly, gradually drizzle in the hot cream. Start very slowly to avoid scrambling your eggs. </li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup with a pouring lip. Discard anything left in the sieve. Divide the mixture into 6 (4-oz) ramekins and place in a 9×13 casserole dish. </li>
        <li>Fill the baking dish with boiling water about halfway up the sides of the cups. Bake at 300˚F for 30-35 minutes, or until the centers are nearly set and have just a slight wiggle in the center. Carefully transfer ramekins from the water bath to a wire rack and cool to room temp then cover and refrigerate creme brulee until fully chilled (2 hours or up to 3 days). </li>
        <li>When ready to serve, put 1 1/2 to 2 tsp sugar on each custard, swirling to spread evenly. Torch the top – moving in a circular pattern until the whole surface is caramelized to a deep amber color.</li>
      </ol>
